<h1>Visit Bedfordshire Website.</h1>
First Milestone Project:User-Centric Frontend Development.
This is my website to introduce visitors to Bedfordshire and to encourage them to visit.
The project highlights a number of places throughout the county to visit and explore, as wellas
a contact form asking people to join an email list to receive advanced notification of events.
There is also a page of general infomation about the county, a highlight page of autumn and 
winter2019 events, and a section detailing the transport links to the county.
<h2>UX</h2>
My goal in the design was to highlight the wide variety of activities available to families and individuals in the less well-known county of Bedfordshire. I wanted my design to be bright and attractive to a younger demographic, and away from the traditional,stuffier view of Bedfordshire as the birthplace of John Bunyan and 17th century Puritanism. I wanted people to have quick and easy links to explore further the places and events listed. There are also links to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, so that people can explore further the physical activities available, and the wildlife of the county.

<h2>Features</h2>
My project features the 'ScrollSpy' feature which highlights the section of the page as the viewer scrolls down or up the page. This used a JQuery plugin This was taken from W3schools 'scrollspy tutorial'. <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_scrollspy.asp" target="_blank">Click here to view</a> <h2>Features left to Implement</h2> In the future, I should like to change the static landing-page to one that had a slide-show of images of Bedfordshire in order to attract the attention of more potential visitors. In addition, I would make the images appropriate to the season. I should also like the contact form to be more specific, with check boxes so that visitors could get targeted emails according to their particular interests, such as 'health and well-being', 'cycling', 'food and drink', and 'gardens and heritage'. Also the highlights section would change according to the season. <h2>Testing</h2> The project was tested on multiple mobile devices, including Galaxy s5, iphone6,7,8 and ipad Pro, and on variou browsers including opera and safari, and firefox to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. All links and hover effects were tested manually, and all links will open using target="_blank" in a new tab.The 'Required' attribute is added to the 'name', 'email'. and 'message', fields, so that the form would not submit if these are not filled in. A bug left to fix is that I had wanted the top third of the 'event' cards on desktop to have an appropriate image, such as an animal for Whipsnade zoo, but I found that I kept getting a 'ghost' card with the image on it, and the text on the original card. <h2>Content</h2> All content was written by me. <h2>Media</h2> All photos were from Google images advanced search to be free from copywrite.<h2>Acknowledgements</h2> The 'event' cards and contact form were from 'getBootstrap's component section. <h2>Libraries Used</h2> <ul><li>bootstrap.min.css<li>bootstrap.min.js<li>jquery,min.js
